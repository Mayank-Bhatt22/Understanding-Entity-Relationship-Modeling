# Understanding-Entity-Relationship-Modeling
Built a relational database system using SQL with E-R modeling, keys, and realistic relationships. This project will be expanded with additional real-world database modules.
# 🗃️ Relational Database Systems with SQL
This project is a collection of relational database systems built using SQL, starting with a Student-Course Enrollment System based on E-R modeling and normalization principles.

# 📌 More real-world database modules will be added soon.

# 🧠 Key Concepts Applied
Relational Database Design

Entity-Relationship Modeling

SQL Table Creation

Primary and Foreign Keys

Many-to-Many Relationships

Data Integrity

Sample Data Insertion

#💡 How to Use
Clone the repo
Run .sql files in any SQL-compatible environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Use SELECT and JOIN queries to explore relationships

# 🙌 Acknowledgment
This project is part of my personal learning roadmap and will grow into a rich library of normalized SQL-based database systems.
